        "# Minimum Wage Example Notebook\n",
        "This notebook implements Difference-in-Differences in an application on the effect of minimum wage changes on teen employment. We use data from [Callaway (2022)](https://bcallaway11.github.io/files/Callaway-Chapter-2022/main.pdf), for further details on the analysis, please read his paper. The observations are US counties, with the outcome being county-level teen employment. Data was collected in a time period from 2001-2007 where the federal minimum wage was constant.\n",

The dataset ultimately includes a balanced panel of counties from 42 states from 2001-2007.

        "We are going to compare the groups of treated and untreated counties in some summary statistics. Treated refers to counties that had a minimum wage higher than the ferderal minimum wage in any period from 2002-2007. The comparison will be for 2001, as this is pre-treatment for all observations. It is evident, that counties in the treated group had already before treatment a significantly higher teen employment. Also, they tend to have higher population. The average pay shows no mayor deviation between treated and non-treated group. Counties that are not treated are more likely in region 3, which is the south. Meanwhile in region 1, referring to the northeast, there is not a single observation of a county without treatment.\n"
