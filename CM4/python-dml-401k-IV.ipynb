The key problem in determining the effect of participation in 401(k) plans on accumulated assets is saver heterogeneity coupled with the fact that the decision to enroll in a 401(k) is non-random. It is generally recognized that some people have a higher preference for saving than others. It also seems likely that those individuals with high unobserved preference for saving would be most likely to choose to participate in tax-advantaged retirement savings plans and would tend to have otherwise high amounts of accumulated assets. The presence of unobserved savings preferences with these properties then implies that conventional estimates that do not account for saver heterogeneity and endogeneity of participation will be biased upward, tending to overstate the savings effects of 401(k) participation.\n","\n","One can argue that eligibility for enrolling in a 401(k) plan in this data can be taken as exogenous after conditioning on a few observables of which the most important for their argument is income. The basic idea is that, at least around the time 401(k)â€™s initially became available, people were unlikely to be basing their employment decisions on whether an employer offered a 401(k) but would instead focus on income and other aspects of the job."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"divine-phoenix","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.036497,"end_time":"2021-03-24T14:13:51.229370","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-03-24T14:13:51.192873","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"divine-phoenix"},"source":["### Data\n","\n","The data set can be downloaded from the github repo\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install wget"],"metadata":{"id":"teq-s8pb3a82"},"id":"teq-s8pb3a82","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"75662e18","metadata":{"id":"75662e18"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import relevant packages\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict, KFold\n","from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV, RidgeCV, ElasticNetCV, LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, LogisticRegressionCV\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor, GradientBoostingClassifier\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor, DecisionTreeClassifier\n","import patsy\n","import warnings\n","from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, clone\n","import statsmodels.api as sm\n","from IPython.display import Markdown\n","import os\n","import wget\n","import seaborn as sns\n","warnings.simplefilter('ignore')\n","np.random.seed(1234)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6e66e77f","metadata":{"id":"6e66e77f"},"outputs":[],"source":["file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CausalAIBook/MetricsMLNotebooks/main/data/401k.csv\"\n","data = pd.read_csv(file)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"65a2d086","metadata":{"id":"65a2d086"},"outputs":[],"source":["data.describe()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"00884061","metadata":{"id":"00884061"},"outputs":[],"source":["data.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1d3dc85c","metadata":{"id":"1d3dc85c"},"outputs":[],"source":["readme = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CausalAIBook/MetricsMLNotebooks/main/data/401k.md\"\n","filename = wget.download(readme)\n","display(Markdown(open(filename, 'r').read()))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"looking-invention","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.037509,"end_time":"2021-03-24T14:13:52.250583","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-03-24T14:13:52.213074","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"looking-invention"},"source":["The data consist of 9,915 observations at the household level drawn from the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).

In other words, it assumes a structural equation model of the form:\n","\\begin{eqnarray*}\n","Y & := & g_Y(X, \\epsilon_Y) D + f_Y(A, X, \\epsilon_Y),  \\\\\n","D & := & f_D(Z, X, A, \\epsilon_D), \\\\\n","Z & := & f_Z(X, \\epsilon_Z),\\\\\n","A & : =  & f_A(X, \\epsilon_A), \\\\\n","X & := &  \\epsilon_X,\n","\\end{eqnarray*}\n","where $A$ is a vector of un-observed confounders. Under these assumptions the average treatment effect is identifiable (not just the local average treatment effect). In particular, the average treatment effect can be identified as:\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\alpha := E[Y(1) - Y(0)] = E\\left[ \\frac{Cov(Y, Z\\mid X)}{Cov(D, Z\\mid X)} \\right] = E\\left[ \\frac{E[\\tilde{Y} \\tilde{Z}\\mid X]}{E[\\tilde{Z} \\tilde{D}\\mid X]} \\right]\n","\\end{align}\n","where for any variable $V$ we have $\\tilde{V}=V-E[V|X]$.\n","\n","However, the variance of this method can be quite larger than the LATE method, since it uses a local compliance measure, i.e. $E[\\tilde{Z} \\tilde{D}\\mid X]$, which can be small for some regions of $X$. This extra variance stems from the fact that we are going after a more challenging causal quantity which is the average treatment effect, instead of the local average treatment effect, and hence we need to re-weight the data based on compliance levels, conditional on observable covariates $X$."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"122ab658","metadata":{"id":"122ab658"},"outputs":[],"source":["from econml.iv.dr import LinearDRIV\n","\n","driv = LinearDRIV(model_y_xw=LassoCV(cv=cv),\n","                  model_t_xw=LogisticRegressionCV(cv=cv),\n","                  model_t_xwz=LogisticRegressionCV(cv=cv),\n","                  model_tz_xw=LassoCV(cv=cv),\n","                  flexible_model_effect=LassoCV(cv=cv),\n","                  projection=True,\n","                  discrete_instrument=True, discrete_treatment=True, cv=3, cov_clip=0.01, random_state=123)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7e878a86","metadata":{"id":"7e878a86"},"outputs":[],"source":["driv.fit(y, D, Z=Z, W=W)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"dd8e664a","metadata":{"id":"dd8e664a"},"outputs":[],"source":["driv.summary()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a629b091","metadata":{"id":"a629b091"},"source":["# Using the DoubleML Package\n","\n","We run through IIVM using `DoubleML` below to illustrate.
