Since $Y$ and $D$ are jointly determined, we need an external factor, commonly referred to as an instrument, $Z$ to create exogenous variation\n",

Health outcome $Y$ and smoking behavior $D$ are treated as being jointly determined.  $X$ represents patient characteristics, and $Z$ could be a doctor's advice not to smoke (or another behavioral treatment) that may affect the outcome $Y$ only through shifting the behavior $D$, conditional on characteristics $X$.   \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Here, we consider one specific approach based upon the statistic:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(\\theta) = \\frac{ |E_n [(\\tilde Y -  \\theta  \\tilde D) \\tilde Z]|^2}{ \\mathbb{V}_n [(\\tilde Y -  \\theta \\tilde  D) \\tilde Z ]/n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The empirical variance $\\mathbb{V}_n$ is defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{V}_{n}[ g(W_i)] &:=   \\mathbb{E}_{n}g(W_i)g(W_i)' - \\mathbb{E}_{n}[ g(W_i)]\\mathbb{E}_{n}[ g(W_i)]'.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\theta_0 = \\theta$, then $C(\\theta) \\overset{a}{\\sim} N(0,1)^2 = \\chi^2(1)$. Therefore,  we can reject the hypothesis $\\theta_0 = \\theta$ at level $a$ (for example $a = .05$ for a 5\\% level test)  if $C(\\theta)> c(1-a)$ where $c(1-a)$ is the $(1-a)$- quantile of a $\\chi^2(1)$ variable.  The probability of falsely rejecting the true hypothesis is approximately $a \\times 100\\%$.  \n",

    "learned cross-fitted residuals $\\check Y$, $\\check D$, and $ \\check Z$.  Thanks to the orthogonality of the IV moment condition underlying the formulation outlined above, we can formally assert that the properties of $C(\\theta)$ and the subsequent testing procedure and confidence region for $\\theta$ continue to hold when using cross-fitted residuals. We will further be able to apply the general procedure to cases where $D$\n",
