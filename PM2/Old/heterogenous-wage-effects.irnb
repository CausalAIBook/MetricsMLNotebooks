The dependent variable is the logarithm of the wage, the target variable is *female* (in combination with other variables). All other variables denote some other socio-economic characteristics, e.g. marital status, education, and experience.  For a detailed description of the variables we refer to the help page.\n\n\n\nThis analysis allows a closer look how discrimination according to gender is related to other socio-economic variables.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"library(hdm)\ndata(cps2012)\nstr(cps2012)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# create the model matrix for the covariates\nX <- model.matrix(~-1 + female + female:(widowed + divorced + separated + nevermarried +\nhsd08 + hsd911 + hsg + cg + ad + mw + so + we + exp1 + exp2 + exp3) + +(widowed +\ndivorced + separated + nevermarried + hsd08 + hsd911 + hsg + cg + ad + mw + so +\nwe + exp1 + exp2 + exp3)^2, data = cps2012)\nX <- X[, which(apply(X, 2, var) != 0)] # exclude all constant variables\ndim(X)\n\n# target variables, index.gender specifices coefficients we are interested in\nindex.gender <- grep(\"female\", colnames(X))\ny <- cps2012$lnw","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The parameter estimates for the target parameters, i.e. all coefficients related to gender (i.e. by interaction with other variables) are calculated and summarized by the following commands:\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"effects.female <- rlassoEffects(x = X, y = y, index = index.gender)\nsummary(effects.female)\nlibrary(stargazer)\nstargazer(summary(effects.female)[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, we estimate and plot confident intervals, first \"pointwise\" and then the joint confidence intervals."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"joint.CI <- confint(effects.female, level = 0.95)\njoint.CI\nplot(effects.female, level=0.95) # plot of the effects\nstargazer(joint.CI)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, we compare the pointwise confidence intervals to joint confidence intervals."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"joint.CI <- confint(effects.female, level = 0.95, joint = TRUE)\njoint.CI\nplot(effects.female, joint=TRUE, level=0.95) # plot of the effects\nstargazer(joint.CI)\n\n# the plot output does not look great","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"ir","display_name":"R","language":"R"},"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"3.6.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
