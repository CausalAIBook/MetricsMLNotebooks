# Applied Causal ML Notebooks

If you are facing difficulties running a notebook on your environment, try installing the packages in the requirements.txt file of the repo.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# For Contributors

The .Rmd files are auto-generated by a Github Action, whenever one pushes a .irnb (R Jupyter notebook) to one of the main folders of the repo. So .Rmd files, should never be altered directly. Only changes to .irnb files should be made. Any change to a .Rmd file will be over-written by the corresponding .irnb file and will not survive the Github Action.
