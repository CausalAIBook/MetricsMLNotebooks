# Using Dagitty in the Analysis of Impact of 401(k) on Net Financial Wealth


```{r _uuid="051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a", _execution_state="idle"}
#install and load package
install.packages("dagitty")
install.packages("ggdag")
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

```

# Graphs for 401(K) Analsyis



# Here we have
 # * $Y$ -- net financial assets;
 # * $X$ -- worker characteristics (income, family size, other retirement plans; see lecture notes for details);
 # * $F$ -- latent (unobserved) firm characteristics
 # * $D$ -- 401(K) eligibility, deterimined by $F$ and $X$


# State one graph (where F determines X) and plot it


```{r}
#generate a DAGs and plot them

G1 = dagitty('dag{
Y [outcome,pos="4, 0"]
D [exposure,pos="0, 0"]
X [confounder, pos="2,-2"]
F [uobserved, pos="0, -1"]
D -> Y
X -> D
F -> X
F -> D
X -> Y}')


ggdag(G1)+  theme_dag()
```

# List minimal adjustment sets to identify causal effecs $D \to Y$



```{r}
adjustmentSets( G1, "D", "Y",effect="total" ) 
```

# What is the underlying principle? 

Here condition on X blocks backdoor paths from Y to D (Pearl).  Dagitty correctly finds X (and does many more correct decisions, when we consider more elaborate structures. Why do we want to consider more elaborate structures? The very empirical problem requires us to do so!


# Another Graph (wherere $X$ determine $F$):

```{r}
#generate a couple of DAGs and plot them

G2 = dagitty('dag{
Y [outcome,pos="4, 0"]
D [exposure,pos="0, 0"]
X [confounder, pos="2,-2"]
F [uobserved, pos="0, -1"]
D -> Y
X -> D
X -> F
F -> D
X -> Y}')


ggdag(G2)+  theme_dag()
```

```{r}
adjustmentSets( G2, "D", "Y", effect="total" )

```

# One more graph (encompassing previous ones), where (F, X) are jointly determined by latent factors $A$. We can allow in fact the whole triple (D, F, X) to be jointly determined by latent factors $A$.


This is much more realistic graph to consider.

```{r}
G3 = dagitty('dag{
Y [outcome,pos="4, 0"]
D [exposure,pos="0, 0"]
X [confounder, pos="2,-2"]
F [unobserved, pos="0, -1"]
A [unobserved, pos="-1, -1"]
D -> Y
X -> D
F -> D
A -> F
A -> X
A -> D
X -> Y}')

adjustmentSets( G3, "D", "Y", effect="total"  ) 

ggdag(G3)+  theme_dag()
```

# Threat to Idenitification: What if $F$ also directly affects $Y$? (Note that there are no valid adjustment sets in this case)

```{r}
G4 = dagitty('dag{
Y [outcome,pos="4, 0"]
D [exposure,pos="0, 0"]
X [confounder, pos="2,-2"]
F [unobserved, pos="0, -1"]
A [unobserved, pos="-1, -1"]
D -> Y
X -> D
F -> D
A -> F
A -> X
A -> D
F -> Y
X -> Y}')


ggdag(G4)+  theme_dag()
```

```{r}
adjustmentSets( G4, "D", "Y",effect="total"  )

```

Note that no output means that there is no valid adustment set (among observed variables)


# How can F affect Y directly? Is it reasonable?


# Introduce Match Amount $M$ (very important mediator, why mediator?). $M$ is not observed.  Luckily adjusting for $X$ still works if there is no $F \to M$ arrow.

```{r}
G5 = dagitty('dag{
Y [outcome,pos="4, 0"]
D [exposure,pos="0, 0"]
X [confounder, pos="2,-2"]
F [unobserved, pos="0, -1"]
A [unobserved, pos="-1, -1"]
M [unobserved, pos="2, -.5"]
D -> Y
X -> D
F -> D
A -> F
A -> X
A -> D
D -> M
M -> Y
X -> M
X -> Y}')

print( adjustmentSets( G5, "D", "Y",effect="total"  ) )

ggdag(G5)+  theme_dag()
```

# If  there is $F \to M$ arrow, then adjusting for $X$ is not sufficient.

```{r}
G6 = dagitty('dag{
Y [outcome,pos="4, 0"]
D [exposure,pos="0, 0"]
X [confounder, pos="2,-2"]
F [unobserved, pos="0, -1"]
A [unobserved, pos="-1, -1"]
M [uobserved, pos="2, -.5"]
D -> Y
X -> D
F -> D
A -> F
A -> X
D -> M
F -> M
A -> D
M -> Y
X -> M
X -> Y}')

print( adjustmentSets( G6, "D", "Y" ),effect="total"  )

ggdag(G6)+  theme_dag()
```

 # Question:
 
Given the analysis above, do you find the adjustment for workers' characteristics a credible strategy to identify the causal (total effect) of 401 (k) elligibility on net financial wealth?
