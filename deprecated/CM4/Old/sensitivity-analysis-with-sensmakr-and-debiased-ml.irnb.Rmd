# Sensititivy Analysis for Unobserved Confounder with DML and Sensmakr


## Here we experiment with using package "sensemakr" in conjunction with debiased ML

## We will 

## * mimic the partialling out procedure with machine learning tools, 

## * and invoke Sensmakr to compute $\phi^2$ and plot sensitivity results.

Data is described here 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensemakr/vignettes/sensemakr.html

The main outcome is attitude towards peace -- the peacefactor.
The key variable of interest is whether the responders were directly harmed (directlyharmed).
We want to know if being directly harmed in the conflict causes people to support peace-enforcing measures.
The measured confounders include female indicator, age, farmer, herder, voted in the past, and household size.
There is also a village indicator, which we will treat as fixed effect and partial it out before conducting
the analysis. The standard errors will be clustered at the village level.
