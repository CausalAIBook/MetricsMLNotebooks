    "\n",
    "One of the earliest randomized experiments were the Polio vaccination trials conducted by the Public Health Service in 1954.  The question was whether Salk vaccine prevented polio.  Children in the study were randomly assigned either a treatment (polio vaccine shot) or a placebo (saline solution shot), without knowing which one they received. The doctors in the study, making the diagnosis, did not know whether a child received a vaccine or not. In other words, the trial was a double-blind, randomized control trial.  The trial had to be large, because the rate at which Polio occured in the population was 50 per 100,000.  The treatment group saw 33 polio cases per 200,745; the control group saw 115 cases per 201,229. The estimated average treatment effect is about\n",

    "-40\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with 95% confidence band (based on approximate normality of the two sample means and their differences)\n",
    "$$[-52, -28].$$\n",
    "The confidence suggests that the Polio vaccine **caused** the reduction in the risk of polio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting thing here is that we don't need the underlying individual data to evaluate the effectivess of the vaccine. This is because the outcomes are Bernoulli random variabales, and we have enough information to compute the estimate of ATE as well as the confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also compute Vaccine Efficacy metric, which (I googled  [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html)) refers to the following measure:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\operatorname{VE} = \\frac{\\text{Risk for Unvaccianted - Risk for Vaccinated}}{\\text{Risk for Unvaccianted}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It describes the relative reduction in risk caused by vaccination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is staighborward to get VE estimate by just plugging-in the numbers, but how do we get the approximate variance estimate. I am too lazy to do calculations for the delta methods, so I will just use a simulation (a form of approximate bootstrap) to obtain the confidence intervals.\n",
