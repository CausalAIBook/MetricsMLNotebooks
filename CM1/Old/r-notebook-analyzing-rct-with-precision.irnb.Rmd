# Analyzing RCT with Precision by Adjusting for Baseline Covariates


# Jonathan Roth's DGP

Here we set up a DGP with heterogenous effects. In this example, which is due to Jonathan Roth, we have
$$
E [Y(0) | Z] = - Z, \quad E [Y(1) |Z] = Z, \quad Z \sim N(0,1).
$$
The CATE is
$$
E [Y(1) - Y(0) | Z ]= 2 Z.
$$
and the ATE is
$$
2 E Z = 0.
$$

We would like to estimate the ATE as precisely as possible.

An economic motivation for this example could be provided as follows: Let D be the treatment of going to college, and $Z$ academic skills.  Suppose that academic skills cause lower earnings Y(0) in jobs that don't require college degree, and cause higher earnings  Y(1) in jobs that require college degrees. This type of scenario is reflected in the DGP set-up above.



```{r}
# generate the simulated dataset
set.seed(123)        # set MC seed
n = 1000             # sample size
Z = rnorm(n)         # generate Z
Y0 = -Z + rnorm(n)   # conditional average baseline response is -Z
Y1 = Z + rnorm(n)    # conditional average treatment effect is +Z
D = (runif(n)<.2)    # treatment indicator; only 20% get treated 
Y = Y1*D + Y0*(1-D)  # observed Y
D = D - mean(D)      # demean D
Z = Z-mean(Z)        # demean Z
```

# Analyze the RCT data with Precision Adjustment

Consider the follow regression models:

*  classical 2-sample approach, no adjustment (CL)
*  classical linear regression adjustment (CRA)
*  interactive regression adjusment (IRA)

We carry out inference using heteroskedasticity robust inference, using the sandwich formulas for variance (Eicker-Huber-White).  

We observe that the CRA delivers estimates that are less efficient than the CL (pointed out by Freedman), whereas the IRA delivers a more efficient approach (pointed out by Lin). In order for the CRA to be more efficient than the CL, we need the CRA to be a correct model of the conditional expectation function of Y given D and X, which is not the case here.

```{r}
# implement each of the models on the simulated data
CL = lm(Y ~ D)          
CRA = lm(Y ~ D+ Z)      #classical
IRA = lm(Y ~ D+ Z+ Z*D) #interactive approach

# we are interested in the coefficients on variable "D".
library(sandwich) # heterokedasticity robust standard errors
library(lmtest) # coefficient testing
coeftest(CL, vcov = vcovHC(CL, type="HC1"))
coeftest(CRA, vcov = vcovHC(CRA, type="HC1"))
coeftest(IRA, vcov = vcovHC(IRA, type="HC1"))
```

# Using classical standard errors (non-robust) is misleading here.

We don't teach non-robust standard errors in econometrics courses, but the default statistical inference for lm() procedure in R, summary.lm(), still uses 100-year old concepts, perhaps in part due to historical legacy.  

Here the non-robust standard errors suggest that there is not much difference between the different approaches, contrary to the conclusions reached using the robust standard errors.
