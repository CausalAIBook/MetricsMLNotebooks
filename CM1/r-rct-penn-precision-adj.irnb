These experiments were conducted in the 1980s by the U.S. Department of Labor to test the incentive effects of alternative compensation schemes for unemployment insurance (UI). In these experiments, UI claimants were randomly assigned either to a control group or one of six treatment groups. Here we focus on treatment group 4, but feel free to explore other treatment groups. In the control group, the current rules of UI applied. Individuals in the treatment groups were offered a cash bonus if they found a job within some pre-specified period of time (qualification period), provided that the job was retained for a specified duration. The treatments differed in the level of the bonus, the length of the qualification period, and whether the bonus was declining over time in the qualification period; see http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/2000-v15.6/bilias/readme.b.txt for further details on data.\n","  "]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"_whbk2z4elkY"},"cell_type":"code","source":["## loading the data\n","file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CausalAIBook/MetricsMLNotebooks/main/data/penn_jae.dat\"\n","Penn <- as.data.frame(read.table(file, header=T))\n","\n","n <- dim(Penn)[1]\n","p_1 <- dim(Penn)[2]\n","Penn<- subset(Penn, tg==4 | tg==0)\n","attach(Penn)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"iTghGG4Kelkk"},"cell_type":"code","source":["T4<- (tg==4)\n","summary(T4)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"ZbWuqKExelkl"},"cell_type":"code","source":["summary(Penn)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"72Rx7ECEelkn"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Model\n","To evaluate the impact of the treatments on unemployment duration, we consider the linear regression model:\n","\n","$$\n","Y =  D \\beta_1 + W'\\beta_2 + \\varepsilon, \\quad E \\varepsilon (D,W')' = 0,\n","$$\n","\n","where $Y$ is  the  log of duration of unemployment, $D$ is a treatment  indicators,  and $W$ is a set of controls including age group dummies, gender, race, number of dependents, quarter of the experiment, location within the state, existence of recall expectations, and type of occupation.

Within an RCT, the projection coefficient $\\beta_1$ has the interpretation of the causal effect of the treatment on the average outcome. We thus refer to $\\beta_1$ as the average treatment effect (ATE). Note that the covariates, here are independent of the treatment $D$, so we can identify $\\beta_1$ by just linear regression of $Y$ on $D$, without adding covariates.
