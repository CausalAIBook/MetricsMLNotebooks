## Details
The sample is drawn from the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and consists of 9,915 observations. The observational units are household reference persons aged 25-64 and spouse if present. Households are included in the sample if at least one person is employed and no one is self-employed. The data set was analysed in Chernozhukov and Hansen (2004) and Belloni et al. (2014) where further details can be found. They examine the effects of 401(k) plans on wealth using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation using 401(k) eligibility as an instrument for 401(k) participation.
