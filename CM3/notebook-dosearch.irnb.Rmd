# Dosearch for Causal Identification in DAGs.


This a simple notebook for teaching that illustrates capabilites of the "dosearch" package, which is a great tool. 

NB. In my experience, the commands are sensitive to syntax ( e.g. spacing when -> are used), so be careful when changing to other examples.

```{r _uuid="8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5", _cell_guid="b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}
install.packages("dosearch")
library("dosearch") 


```

We start with the simplest graph, with the simplest example
where $D$ is policy, $Y$ is outcomes, $X$ is a confounder:
$$
D\to Y, \quad X \to (D,Y)
$$



Now suppose we want conditional average policy effect.

```{r}
data <- "p(y,d,x)"  #data structure

query <- "p(y | do(d),x)" #query -- target parameter

graph <- "x -> y
  x -> d 
  d -> y"

dosearch(data, query, graph)
```

This recovers the correct identification formula for law of the counterfactual $Y(d)$ induced by $do(D=d)$:
$$
p_{Y(d)|X}(y|x) := p(y|do(d),x) = p(y|d,x).
$$

```{r}
data <- "p(y,d,x)"

query <- "p(y | do(d))"

graph <- "x -> y
  x -> d 
  d -> y"


dosearch(data, query, graph)

```

This recovers the correct identification formula:
$$
p_{Y(d)}(y) := p(y: do(d)) = \sum_{x}\left(p(x)p(y|d,x)\right) 
$$
We integreate out $x$ in the previous formula.



Suppose we don't observe the confounder. The effect is generally not identified.


```{r}

data <- "p(y,d)"

query <- "p(y | do(d))"

graph <- "x -> y
  x -> d 
  d -> y"

dosearch(data, query, graph)

```

The next graph is an example of J. Pearl (different notation), where the graph is considerably more complicated. We are interested in $D \to Y$.

Here we try conditioning on $X_2$. This would block one backdoor path from $D$ to $Y$, but would open another path on which $X_2$ is a collider, so this shouldn't work. The application below gave a correct answer (after I put the spacings carefully).


```{r}

data <- "p(y,d,x2)"   #observed only (Y, D, X_2)

query<- "p(y|do(d))"   #target parameter

graph<- "z1 -> x1
z1 -> x2
z2 -> x2
z2 -> x3
x2 -> d
x2 -> y
x3 -> y
x1 -> d
d -> m
m -> y
"

dosearch(data, query, graph)

```

Intuitively, we should add more common causes. For example, adding $X_3$ and using $S = (X_2, X_3)$ should work.

```{r}

data <- "p(y,d,x2,x3)"

conditional.query<- "p(y|do(d),x2, x3)"  #can ID conditional average effect?
query<- "p(y|do(d))"  #can ID unconditional effect?

graph<- "z1 -> x1
z1 -> x2
z2 -> x2
z2 -> x3
x2 -> d
x2 -> y
x3 -> y
x1 -> d
d -> m
m -> y
"

print(dosearch(data, conditional.query, graph))
print(dosearch(data, query, graph))

```

This retrives correct formulas for counterfactual distributions of $Y(d)$ induced by $Do(D=d)$:

The conditional distribution is identified by:
$$
p_{Y(d) \mid X_2, X_3}(y) := p(y |x_2, x_3: do(d)) = p(y|x_2,x_3,d).
$$

The unconditional distribution is obtained by integration out $x_2$ and $x_3$:

$$
p_{Y(d) }(y) :=  p(y do(d)) = \sum_{x2,x3}\left(p(x_2,x_3)p(y|x_2,x_3,d)\right).
$$





Next we suppose that we observe only $(Y,D, M)$. Can we identify the effect $D \to Y$?  Can we use back-door-criterion twice to get $D \to M$ and $M \to Y$ affect? Yes, that's called front-door criterion -- so we just need to remember only the back-door and the fact that we can use it iteratively.

```{r}
data <- "p(y,d, m)" 

query.dm<- "p(m|do(d))" 
query.md<- "p(y|do(m))" 
query<- "p(y|do(d))"

graph<- "z1 -> x1
z1 -> x2
z2 -> x2
z2 -> x3
x2 -> d
x2 -> y
x3 -> y
x1 -> d
d -> m
m -> y
"
print(dosearch(data, query.dm, graph))
print(dosearch(data, query.md, graph))
print(dosearch(data, query, graph))

```

So we get identification results:
First,
$$
p_{M(d)}(m)  := p(m|do(d)) = p(m|d).
$$
Second,
$$
p_{Y(m)}(y) := p(y|do(m)) = \sum_{d}\left(p(d)p(y|d,m)\right), 
$$
and the last by integrating the product of these two formulas:
$$
p_{Y(d)}(y) := p(y|do(d)) = \sum_{m}\left(p(m|d)\sum_{d}\left(p(d)p(y|d,m)\right)\right) 
$$



The package is very rich and allows identification analysis, when the data comes from multiple sources. Suppose we observe marginal distributions $(Y,D)$  and $(D,M)$ only. Can we identify the effect of $D \to Y$. The answer is (guess) and the package correctly recovers it.

```{r}
data <- "p(y,m)
         p(m,d)" 

query.dm<- "p(m|do(d))" 
query.md<- "p(y|do(m))" 
query<- "p(y|do(d))"

graph<- "z1 -> x1
z1 -> x2
z2 -> x2
z2 -> x3
x2 -> d
x2 -> y
x3 -> y
x1 -> d
d -> m
m -> y
"
print(dosearch(data, query.dm, graph))
print(dosearch(data, query.md, graph))
print(dosearch(data, query, graph))
```
